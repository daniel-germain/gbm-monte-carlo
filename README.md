# GBM Monte Carlo Simulation

This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation using geometric Brownian 
motion (GBM) to forecast stock prices. It uses real financial data from 
Yahoo Finance and simulates thousands of possible future price paths.

## Features

- Historical backtesting
- Log return drift and volatility estimation
- Simulation of thousands of GBM paths
- Visualization and summary statistics

## Status

🚧 Work in progress
